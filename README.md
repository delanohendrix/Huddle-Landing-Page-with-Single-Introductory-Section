## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I would like to become more comfortable making responsive designs, or at the very least design with that aspect in mind so I don't have to go back and changed tons of aspects later.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Reference](https://cssreference.io/) - This site helped me by refreshing me on the usage of various css attributes and properties.
- [w3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This site helped by providing examples on how to handle background images better.
